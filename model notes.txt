Tried shape gestures, with categories as follows:
#### shapes, sizes
no_gesture
small
this_big
# drawn shapes
round_drawn
square_drawn
triangle_drawn
# set position
love_heart_set
round_set
triangle_set

Found that 35 frames per example, hidden state size of 5, single layer model trained for 100 epochs does quite well, but the drawn shapes are quite difficult to distinguish from one another.

Increasing to 45 frames didn't seem to do much. Making the model bidirectional helped a bit.
