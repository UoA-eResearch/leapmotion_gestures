#### directional gestures. Maybe a separate classifier for these?
# left
# right
# up
# down
# forward
# back
# diagonal

# cover
# pause, maybe 'stop' already covers this?

######## discarded ########

# brush, replaced by drawing
# push, replaced by gather leaves. Distinguising pushing vs gathering potentially difficult.
# hold, replaced by cup hands (if I even understood 'hold' correctly to begin with) 
# wiggle, replaced by finger tracing
