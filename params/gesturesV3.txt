# Note that the order in which gestures appears determines their integer id.
# If the order of these gestures is changed after a model is trained, this file will not work with that model.
# Empty lines and lines beggining with '#' are ignored.

finger_drawing

##### other gestures that can be performed continuously
multiple
smoothing_sand
# like using steering wheel
driving
# hands open, upwards
why
# path is like this_big, except with forwards and backwards movement
path
# Not necessarily leaves, but it helps to identify the action
gather_leaves
# replaces drop/place, which were often performed together
robotic_arm
# as though drinking water
cup_hands
# not like finger drawing. Hand position is like holding pen or brush.
drawing

#### directional gestures. Maybe a separate classifier for these? They occur all the time as parts of other gestures.
# left
# right
# up
# down
# forward
# back
# diagonal

#### drop temporarily, bring in when double leap motion sensor is running? Or maybe ignore. These are also like parts of other gestures.
# shrink, this is like gather leaves + some kind of holding at the end.
# expand


#### unsure
# drop
# cover
# pause, maybe 'stop' already covers this?
# counting_hands_apart, not included for now

######## discarded ########

# brush, replaced by drawing
# push, replaced by gather leaves. Distinguising pushing vs gathering potentially difficult.
# hold, replaced by cup hands (if I even understood 'hold' correctly to begin with) 
# wiggle, replaced by finger tracing
